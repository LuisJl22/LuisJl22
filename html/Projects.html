        <p1> These are some of the projects I have been able to be a part of, feel free to check them out ! <br>

        <div class="grid-container" >
            <p> One time for a project I created a dice roll game in C++. The following snippet 1 shows<br>
                how the "currentRoll" will determine what will be displayed to the user. For example, <br>
                if "currentRoll" is equivalent to 1, the dice value will display accordingly. </p>

             <div class="grid-item"> <img src = "../images/Project2.png" alt="Python RegEx pattern" figcaption>
                code snippet 2 </figcaption></div>
              <p class="p1"> I have also gotten the opportunity to learn RegEx <br>
                 in my Python Class code snippet 2 has criteria <br>
                 requiring that that a company name has to <br>
                 end with Co at the end.</p>
               <p>Another project I was able to be involved was an attempt to motorize mirror<br>
                mounts on a budget. Some may know that kinematic mirror mounts can be expensive.<br> 
                Using 2 servo motors, an Arduino programmed with C++, and a 3D printed housing<br>
                a budget mirror mount now became available. With a program written to tilt the <br>
                X & Y Axis, percise angles were able to be read / achieved thanks to the program, <br>
                This kind of information can be especially important when handling lasers, or photonics.
