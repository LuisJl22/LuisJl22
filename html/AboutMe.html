        <p1>Hello, My name is Luis Lozano, I am currently a student at Indian Hills Community College<br>studying Computer Software Development.
            Outside of school I coach u12 soccer, I enjoy sharing my love for the sport with young athletes.<br>
            Being able to help and support kids and through their own passion, along with the benefits of playing youth sports,<br>
            is something I find beyond rewarding. </p1>
